# Monitoring

chasquid includes an HTTP server for monitoring purposes, which for security
it is not enabled by default.

You can use the `monitoring_address` configuration option to enable it.

Then just browse the address and human-friendly links to various monitoring
and debugging tools should appear.

These include:

- Command-line flags.
- [Traces](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/trace) of both short and long
  lived requests (sampled).
- State of the queue.
- State of goroutines.
- [Exported variables](#variables) for whitebox monitoring.
- Profiling endpoints, for use with `go tool pprof` or similar tools.


## Variables

chasquid exports some variables for monitoring, via the standard
[expvar](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/) package and the
[OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/) text format, which can be useful for
whitebox monitoring.

They're accessible on the monitoring HTTP server, at `/debug/vars` (default
endpoint for expvars) and `/metrics` (common endpoint for openmetrics).

<a name="prometheus"></a>
The `/metrics` endpoint is also compatible with
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

*Note these are still subject to change, although breaking changes will be
avoided whenever possible, and will be noted in the
[release notes](relnotes.md).*
